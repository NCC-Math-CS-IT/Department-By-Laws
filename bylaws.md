# Department Philosophy

Since the founding of the department in 1964, our philosophy has been to promote excellence, both in the education of our students and in the professional growth of our faculty. To accomplish this goal, we look to promote an atmosphere in which students and colleagues alike are treated with respect, problem solving is handled with objectivity, varying opinions are regarded as valuable and as such are seriously considered, and a productive atmosphere is encouraged. Students’ performance should be carefully monitored through frequent evaluation, and faculty should meet regularly to discuss curriculum and textbook concerns so that the curriculum may appropriately evolve and change.

In order to help support our new faculty and ease their transition into the department, each newly hired full-time faculty member is assigned a volunteer mentor who has been at the college for many years, to provide a source of information about department and/or college policy and to be consultant at any time of uncertainty.

# Faculty Academic Responsiblities

Faculty responsibilities include attendance at necessary and regularly scheduled college-wide and department meetings. Attendance at commencement exercise is mandatory for 67% of the faculty for each commencement. Each year the list of those required to attend will be provided by the Chairperson.

In addition to their assigned classroom teaching responsibilities classroom faculty must work at least five hours per week in related professional endeavors, and shall maintain a minimum of two and one-half hours per week of published office hours for consultation with students. Also, classroom faculty are responsible for student academic advisement during the regular semesters, intersessions, during the period prior to the start of classes in September and between final examinations and commencement. Work schedules during these special periods will be determined by the Chairperson and the Personnel and Budget Committee (see Appendix, pp. 25-26).

Professional non-classroom faculty have diverse supportive professional responsibilities in the Mathematics and Computer Centers as detailed by the P&B committee and the Department Chairperson.

All committee chairs or their designee are to keep records of attendance at meetings, and minutes of all decisions. These minutes shall be distributed to members within one week of each meeting.

All committee chairs or their designee should provide members with yearly written documentation of their service using the Department Committee Service Form in the Appendix of the Department Bylaws (see Appendix p. 29).

# Effective Teaching

While recognizing that teaching is an individual effort that displays each teacher’s personality, the department believes that there are common elements that should be included in all presentations. The following is a philosophy and methodology for working with students that we have found to be successful and recommend.

Maintain an objective, courteous and professional relationship with students.

It is at the first class meeting that the teacher sets the tone for future classes. Provide a written presentation of your procedures that details the student’s responsibilities, course requirements, grading procedures, office hours and location, phone number and/or e-mail address, etc. and discuss each requirement. A listing of suggested information may be found in the Appendix under Sample of First Day of Class Information Sheet (see pp. 24-25). Preparing such a document that is ready for students on the first day will establish a guideline for a student’s successful completion of the course.

Passion can be an appropriate part of teaching, but it should be directed in a positive manner, perhaps commenting how the work of the course is interesting, or helpful in other courses, or sought by industry, how this group of students is doing well, etc. Avoid a negative approach. Demanding and well developed exams do the job of separating those who are learning the material and those who are not. If the exams hold the standards at a high level, then negative comments by the teacher directed at an individual or the group are not necessary and they often are not educationally productive. If you feel that it would be helpful to tell a student that this is too difficult a course for his or her skill level, or he or she is not working hard enough, then that should be done outside of class and only to that individual.

It is best if the teacher is perceived as the student advocate - the person with the knowledge that the students need to succeed in the course - who is willing and able to help them. This positive approach promotes: a) honest student questions about what he/she does not understand, b) a more relaxed atmosphere that allows students (and teacher) to think more clearly about the course material, c) students who are appreciative of the professional approach by the teacher.

During examinations students may not have telephones or any other electronic devices on their desks, and must keep these devices turned off during classes.

Each instructor is urged to read the policy statement on classroom management in the College Catalog.

It shall include but not be limited to interactive video transmission, DVD’s, videotapes, online courses, college of the air courses, telecourses, and/or any combination of these multimedia delivery systems. The DE Committee will consist of three appointed members. (see appointment procedure on p. 13)

Only those sections officially designated as distance learning by the registrar may be conducted in such a fashion. No course can be conducted primarily as an online course, or conducted in such a way as to require a student to have computer access at home, unless the section has been specially designated by the registrar.

The DE Committee is responsible for evaluation of proposals for offering a DE format course. This evaluation will include appropriateness of electronic media to the course content, and verification that the course is equivalent to the same conventional course and will be transferable. A “letter of sameness” must be approved by the Department Curriculum Committee and filed with the CWCC for their approval. Evaluation of faculty to teach a particular DE course will be based on a faculty member’s request, proficiency that is either demonstrated or certified, and seniority. A faculty member can teach a maximum of two DE courses during any given semester. The full-time and adjunct contact hour total in distance education courses for any one faculty member shall not exceed seven and one-half contact hours per semester.

**Distance Learning Policy:**

- At the beginning of the semester, for each course, students should be given a detailed Course Outline with clearly defined specific course objectives.
- Frequent evaluations of student work should be required.
- A Letter of Commitment (standard, from the department) should be given to each student with minimum course requirements (meeting, deadlines, and testing requirements). In addition, each course should have its own minimum course requirements which are given to the students at the beginning of the semester.
- At least two proctored on-campus (or satellite campus) tests must be given to each student. One exam should be a mid-term evaluation and the second evaluation should be a final exam. Photo identification must be presented when the student appears for the tests.
- Instructors should check the CWCC Guidelines For Distance Learning Courses (DLE) on LionNet at [http://lionnet.ncc.edu/Portals/14/Guidelines-Distance%20Learning.pdf](http://lionnet.ncc.edu/Portals/14/Guidelines-Distance%20Learning.pdf) each academic year for any updates to the procedure.

# Program Committees

Program committees shall be established for each degree or certificate granting program offered by the department. Each program committee will consist of seven members appointed by the Department Chairperson in consultation with at least one member of the P&B Committee. Any member of the department who has authored a text that is being considered for a course within the scope of the program committee, or anyone who has any financial interest in the selection of a text for such a course, may not serve on that program committee. Each Program Chairperson will be elected for a two-year term by vote of the committee members at an April meeting of the committee. If a Chairperson is unable to complete the term of office, a special election will be held at the committee meeting following the inability notification. Program committees must meet at least once each semester, and a meeting may be called by any two of the members.

Appointment to the additional positions will be for two academic years and can be renewed by request of the course committee. All course committee appointments will be made by the Appointments Committee whose selections must be approved by the P&B Committee. Any member of the department who has authored a text that is being considered for a course, or anyone who has any financial interest in the selection of a text for a course, may not serve on any directly or indirectly involved committee. In April of each odd year, two members will be appointed to the committee for two-year terms, and in each even year, three members will be appointed for two- year terms. Each Course Committee Chairperson will be elected for a two-year term by vote of the committee members at an April meeting of the committee. Odd-numbered courses will elect a chair in odd-numbered years and even-numbered courses will elect in even-numbered years. If a Chairperson is unable to complete the term of office, a special election will be held at the committee meeting following the inability notification. Course committees must meet at least twice each semester, and a meeting may be called by any two of the members. Course committees may appoint additional non-voting faculty to ad hoc committees to complete projects as needed.

The functions of the committee include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. To ensure the evolution of curricula that will best serve the needs of the students. Any changes made to the curriculum must be referred to any affected Program and/or Curriculum Committees for their approval.
1. To consider and recommend an appropriate course text to the Departmental Textbook Committee in accordance with the deadlines set by the Textbook Committee. To support the Mathematics and Computer Centers’ efforts to help students, every effort will be made to limit each course to only one textbook. All department members must be given an opportunity to provide input or participate in discussions before a new selection is made. The final decision will be made by vote of the Course Committee at a scheduled meeting.
1. To undertake periodic course assessment, as required.
1. To collect and review copies of comprehensive final examinations, or copies of all examinations where a comprehensive final is not given, in order to verify that the required topics have been properly covered by each instructor of the course. This responsibility shall be conducted each fall and spring semester for both full-time and adjunct faculty.
1. To review and update course outlines, listing required topics and the recommended number of sessions to be spent on each topic.
1. To communicate changes of curriculum and/or textbooks to the department members at least two months prior to the start of a semester in which they will be used.
1. To provide the Department Chairperson with annual updates of committee activities.

# Bylaws Committee

 The Bylaws committee shall consist of two members. Each year in April or May, one member shall be appointed by the P&B Committee for a two-year term to commence the following September. The duties of the committee are:

- to act as consultants to department members in interpreting the Bylaws.
- to assist department members who wish to propose changes in the Bylaws.
- to make editorial changes to the Bylaws, as needed
- to have the Bylaws printed, when necessary, and to distribute them to the members of the department.

**Procedure for Amending the Bylaws:**

- Any member(s) of the department proposing an amendment to the Bylaws must submit a written copy of the proposed amendment to the Bylaws Committee for determination that the proposed change requires an amendment to the Bylaws, to identify the section to be replaced, if any, and to ensure that the form of the proposal is consistent with the existing Bylaws document. The Bylaws Committee must respond to the proposer(s) within thirty fall/spring semester class meeting days.
- After the Bylaws Committee review is complete, the person(s) proposing the amendment must submit a copy of the proposal to the Department Chair, at least two weeks in advance of the department meeting at which they are requesting consideration of the proposal. If the agenda for the next meeting is full, the Department Chair may hold the proposal for consideration at the next available meeting. Although this review is necessary, the Bylaws Committee cannot prevent the submission of the proposal.
- The person(s) proposing the amendment must distribute copies of the proposed amendment to the members of the department at least one week prior to department meeting at which the amendment will be offered for consideration.
- Any amendment to the Bylaws requires approval by two thirds of the members present at the department meeting at which it is considered.
- If approved, the amendment becomes effective immediately.
- A proposed amendment which was not approved by the required vote at a department meeting cannot be proposed again in its original form for twelve months following the department meeting at which it was considered

# Appendix

## Sample Of First Day Of Class Information Sheet

In order for class to be the well-focused, serious educational environment necessary to bring about effective development of the material in this course, the following will be upheld:

- Students are expected to be on time to all classes. Any student excessively late or absent may be dropped from class (A present policy that has been approved by the Department Chairperson, Personal and Budget Committee, and Office of Academic Affairs is: a student may be dropped if late more than four times, or absent more than five times). Students with any special problems should be directed to talk to the instructor as soon as possible. A student who knows of an absence in advance should speak to the instructor and arrange to make-up the work missed. A student who is ill and misses one or more days should speak to the instructor as soon as possible to discuss the work they missed and how to make it up. Inform students of office hours, email addresses and phone numbers.
- No assignment will be accepted late, unless instructor approval has been obtained prior to the due date.
- Students may make full use of our Mathematics Center in B- 130 to work on their homework, attend their help classes, and/or seek individual help with any mathematics concepts. If a student goes to the Mathematics Center for help, ask them to bring their textbook and a clear idea of what they want to review. Their hours of operation are posted on the center’s door, and are distributed to all department members near the beginning of each semester.

Each student is expected to come to class fully prepared and ready to work, and to contribute or ask questions on the previous assignment(s).

For every class students are expected to have:
- the textbook
- the calculator specified for this course, if any
- a notebook,
- a pen or pencil,
- the completed homework assignment for that day (or a written incomplete reasonable attempt).

Students are required to use their own supplies and not have to share any of the required materials with another student. Students may not share calculators during tests.

There will be four section exams (at least three for three credit courses and four for four credit courses). All exams will be used to calculate a course grade (no exam grades are “dropped” or “curved”, and students cannot retake exams because they performed poorly). There will be a cumulative and mandatory final exam, given over the final two meetings of the semester, which will count as two section exam grades. The final exam grade can also be used to replace any exam that was missed due to illness or for any other reason. If there are four section exams, then their final course grade will be calculated by adding the four section exam grades, plus the final exam grade counted twice, and then the total is divided by six.

Out of respect for the teacher, the course and the students, cell phones or pagers should be turned off during class.

Be aware of the college policy for students with disabilities “If you have a physical, psychological, medical, or learning disability that may impact on your ability to carry out assigned course work, NCC would urge that you contact the staff in The Center for Students with Disabilities at Building "U", 572-7241, TTY 572-7617. The Center for Students with Disabilities will review your concerns and determine with you what accommodations are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation are confidential."

## Advisement Responsibilities

**Fall and Spring Advisement Responsibilities:**

The advisement responsibilities for all teaching faculty during the fall and spring semesters are divided into two categories: *liberal arts advisement* and *advisement for majors*. These responsibilities will follow the current NCCFT contract.

1. The *liberal arts advisement* obligation is an 8 week, 75 minute commitment once every four semesters in the Advisement Center. Faculty assigned for liberal arts advisement will be required to sign-up in the Advisement Center for their 75 minute commitment. This time period selection is conducted on “first come, first serve” basis.

1. The *advisement for majors* is a four semester commitment and takes place in the advisor’s office. Teaching faculty assigned to our majors will be required, every semester, to mail an advisement letter to each of their advisees stating their available advisement time periods.

**Intersession Advisement Responsibilities:**

All teaching and non-teaching faculty have required advisement responsibilities during two of the three intersession advisement periods that occur in: January, May and August.
